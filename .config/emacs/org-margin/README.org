* Level 1

org-margin mode allows to "outdent" org headlines by moving leading stars into the margin and transform them into markers depending on the chosen style among 'stars (regular org style), 'H-txt (current style) and 'H-svg (using svg-lib tags). To increase/decrease level, easiest method is to use =M-left= and =M-right= because stars are not really accessible anymore.

** Level 2

User can also define custom margin markers for each header level. Size of the left margin is then computed to be wide enough to accomodate all markers.

*** Level 3

It is possible to provide custom regex to add specific marker in the margin. Org-margin comes with two markers (from NERD Font) for marking source and quote blocks, but any svg-lib tags or regular text can be used as well.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

(require 'org-margin)
(org-margin-mode 1)

#+end_src

#+begin_quote 
   Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do
   eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
#+end_quote

**** Level 4

A specific bookmark function is provided such as to take advantage of the margin (instead of the fringe).
